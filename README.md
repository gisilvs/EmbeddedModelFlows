# Embedded Model Flows

Code for the implementation of the paper: Embedded-model flows: Combining the inductive biases of model-free deep learning and explicit probabilistic modeling.
This repo contains all the code used in the experiments. You can find an example usage for the time series toy experiments in [this notebook](EmbeddedModelFlows.ipynb).
